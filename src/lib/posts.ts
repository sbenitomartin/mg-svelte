			<blockquote class="blockquote">I'm starving. Omg. Look at that pizza, it looks delicious. I'm gonna eat three of them. I, I, I’m idealizing it, ok, it's true. But I am so hungry.</blockquote>
			<p>In the end, I ate a hole pizza, I felt bad, I didn't really wanted to do it, but I was so hungry. Except, pizza is you, and food is love. I’m starving, of love.</p>
			<p>When I have a little bit of love, romantic, couple, partner, sexual, passionate, intimate, especial, intense love, I’m not that hungry for several days.</p>
			<p>I would like to have a little bit of that every now and then. Ok, I'm gonna be honest. I would love to have a fair amount of that every day, at least for a while. Seems a little bit like if I have a slice of pizza every day for one year, maybe I will never have a craving for pizza that intense never again.</p>
			<p>I’ve been starving for ten years, and I’ve been idealizing that kind of love and relationships.</p>
			<p>It's difficult for me when I have a little bit to not want more. Does it mean I wouldn't be in a relationship with someone who cannot give me that level of time, dedication and intensity that I want?</p>
			<p>I you’re starving would you decline a slice of pizza every now and then because you would like to eat a hole pizza? Wtf, of course not.</p>
			<p>And also, those pizza slices are people. People that you love. So it is a little bit more complicated.</p>
			<p>But yeah, when I find someone, whom I love, and whom I get some love from, I cannot afford not trying to be my best version, keep that, and if there is a possibility of having a little bit more, and being something or being together, I cannot afford not doing it. I just simply can't afford it. I'm still starving.</p>

			<p>Otro día más que me despierto a tu lado, salvo porque tras tres segundos empiezo a darme cuenta de que estoy soñando despierto otra vez, y tras dos segundos más el sueño se rompe del todo, y me siento peor que al principio.</p>
			<p>Yo solo quiero cogerte de la mano y darte un beso en la mejilla, y no sentir que algo me mete el dedo en el corazón y lo retuerce, un par de veces al día. Aunque en realidad si es solo un par de veces, sería un día bueno.</p>
			<p>¿Cuál es la causa de una herida que duele tanto? No quiero pensar más en ello, ya no me aporta hacerlo. ¿Cómo se sana una herida así? No quiero seguir imaginando un pasado o un futuro. Tengo que hacer cualquier cosa, cualquiera, excepto hacer esa herida más grande. Cuando no pienso, y consigo vivir el presente, me hallo feliz.</p>
			<p>Aquí y ahora.</p>
			<p>Ahora que mi culo empuja el suelo, mi cabeza apunta al cielo y una mosca se posa en mi rodilla. Ahora que huele a incienso, una bicicleta pasa por el camino y el viento me acaricia el pelo.</p>
			<p>Ahora que no nos besamos, ni despacio, ni deprisa. Ahora que todavía no me he apuntado a bailes de salón, ni me saludan las floristas, ni te desnudo, ni me desnudas, ni muchas de esas cosas que dice Sabina en aquella canción.</p>
			<p>Ahora que estoy sentado en la cama, escribiendo estas palabras, lo tengo claro. Te quiero, y los momentos que hemos vivido, los de verdad, han sido tan especiales para mí, y los quiero tal y como son. Estoy tan agradecido por nosotros, y el mundo parece tan bonito y emocionante, que voy a seguir luchando por estar aquí y ahora.</p>

			<p>We are all animals and so we all have an impulse to survive. From the rich and businessmen that make use of the work force to perpetuate their patrimony and power. But humankind makes the same using its power over animals, to feed them and killing them in order to eat them.</p> 
			<blockquote class="blockquote">The measure of a society is how it treats its weakest members.</blockquote>
			<p>I think we cannot blame our ancestors for doing so, because they were following their instinct to survive, and livestock or hunting were efficient ways to do so. But nowadays, it is possible to survive without using animals for that purpose. And animals will be animals, and some will kill others to eat them, and we can´t change or interfere in that, but we humans are at a point in which we can choose.</p>
			<p>The same goes with plants, of course on a different level, but it can be applied. We make use of plants for our survival, and non living creatures, and in last instance, of our planet. The difference is that nowadays, the thousand of millions of humans that habitate our planet, cannot survive without this use. Who knows, maybe in the future we will be able to make all the good we need from a laboratory, without the need of interfering or making use of other living creatures.</p> 
			<p>I would like to include myself on that group of people that decided to stop making use of animals, and stop speciesism, because we can actually do it. But personally I am not completely there, yet.</p>
			<p>In any case, if we have to, or we just make use of something, I think a good attitude towards life would always be being thankful for all we’ve got and all the thing we make use of for our survival or enjoy. It has to be. Saying thanks to animals, plants, the sun, and the moon, is cute.</p>

			<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
			<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
			<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
			<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
			<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
			<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
			<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
			<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
			<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

			<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
			<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
			<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
